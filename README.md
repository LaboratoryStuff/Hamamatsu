This repository includes some CAD drawings of some Hamamatsu devices:

- A3179 : Heatsink compatible with 1-stage thermoelectric cooled detectors sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the heatsink datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a A3179-01 (similar to A3179).
  
- A3179-01 : Heatsink compatible with 2-stage thermoelectric cooled detectors sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the heatsink datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a A3179-01.

- A3179-03 : Heatsink compatible with 1-stage thermoelectric cooled two-colour detectors K3413 sealed in a 12 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the heatsink datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a A3179-01 (similar to A3179).
