This repository includes some 3D CAD drawings of some Hamamatsu devices:

- A3179 : Heatsink compatible with 1-stage thermoelectric cooled detectors sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the heatsink datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a A3179-01 (similar to A3179).
- A3179-01 : Heatsink compatible with 2-stage thermoelectric cooled detectors sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the heatsink datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a A3179-01.
- A3179-03 : Heatsink compatible with 1-stage thermoelectric cooled two-colour detectors K3413 sealed in a 12 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the heatsink datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a A3179-01 (similar to A3179).
- G8605-11 / G8605-12 / G8605-13 / G8605-15 : 1-stage thermoelectric cooled InGaAs detector sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a G8605-12.
- G8605-21 / G8605-22 / G8605-23 / G8605-25 : 2-stages thermoelectric cooled InGaAs detector sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a G8605-12.
- G12180-110A / G12180-120A / G12180-130A / G12180-150A : 1-stage thermoelectric cooled InGaAs detector sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a G12180-210A.
- G12180-210A / G12180-220A / G12180-230A / G12180-250A : 2-stages thermoelectric cooled InGaAs detector sealed in a 6 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a G12180-210A.
- H9656 : Metal package photomultiplier (PTM) module with lateral windows with M2 grid of 14 x 14 mm. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of a single copy of a H9656. The same design is valid to many other Hamamatsu PTMs, incluing but not limited to: H9656, H10723 or H11903.
- S1226-18BQ : Si detector sealed in a 2 pin TO-18 package. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of copies of S1226-18BK, S1226-5BQ.
- S1226-5BQ / S1226-44BQ : Si detector sealed in a 2 pin TO-5 package. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of copies of S1226-5BQ and S1226-44BQ.
- S1226-8BQ : Si detector sealed in a 2 pin TO-8 package. Drawing based in the datasheet information and the measurment of copies of S1226-5BQ and S1226-44BQ.
